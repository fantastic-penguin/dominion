# this is the races file.  the format is:
#   - comments at the start (like this one)
#   - a line with the number of races defined in here
#   - comments about the next race described
#   - strings, chars and numbers describing the race, following
#     the fields of the structure Srace, defined in dominion.h
#   - repeat these last 2 steps, for as many races as prescribed
#     at the beginning of this file
#   - a section at the end with a list of army types that are
#     specific to that race.  these require no technology to
#     acquire
#
# for now I have defined Humans, Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, Hobbits, Merfolk,
# Icefolk, Gnomes, Harpies, Ogres, Walruses, Algae, Squid
#
# DO NOT REMOVE THIS NUMBER!!! IT STATES HOW MANY RACES ARE DEFINED!!!
